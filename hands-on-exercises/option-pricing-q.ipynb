The additional parameters that are required to determine the option price are:\n",

    "The solution given by Heston involves complex-valued functions with branch cuts and is not straightforward to evaluate numerically. In particular, errors occur when calculating the Heston prices for options with long times to maturity. Albrecher *et al.* discuss how to avoid errors when using Heston’s model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple check of a function for evaluating the Heston option price can be made by using the parameters specified by Albrecher *et al.* for times to expiry of from 1 to 15 years. When the calculation is handled correctly, plotting the prices will show a\n",

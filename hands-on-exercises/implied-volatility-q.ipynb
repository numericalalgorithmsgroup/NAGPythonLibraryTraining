    "- K: the strike price \n",
    "- T: the maturity\n",
    "- r: the interest rate \n",

    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the documentation for `roots.contfn_cntin`. We are now going to write a program to compute the Black Scholes implied volatility for a given call option price and set of parameters. In other words, given a call option price, C, and values of S, K, T, r, q, find the value of $\\sigma$ so that the Black Scholes formula gives the target price C. Using the template below define a function `bs` for evaluating the option price as a function of $\\sigma$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note the other parameters will still need to be supplied.  Create an array named user to hold 6 values. Assign S, K, T, r, q and Ctarget to the 6 elements of the array user.  In your function `bs`, assign the first 5 members of the user array to variables S, K, T, r and q, and call `specfun.opt_bsm_price` to compute the price of a call option. Return the difference between this price and the 6th member of your user array, Ctarget.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your main program, call `nag_roots_contfn_cntin` and pass it `bs` as the function of which the zero is to be computed. Set eps = eta = 1.0e-6 and set nfmax = 1500.\n",
    "1. Use your program to compute the implied volatility for a (target) call\n",
    "option price of 12.35008695 and S = 100, K = 90, T = 1.5, r = 0.03, q = 0.015.  Use an initial guess of $\\sigma$ = 0.15.\n",
    "2. Use your program to compute the implied volatility for a (target) call\n",
    "option price of 25.5 and S = 100, K = 90, T = 1.5, r = 0.03, q = 0.015.  Use an initial guess of $\\sigma$ = 0.15.\n",
